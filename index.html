					<h3><span style="color: #bce1eb;"><em>NAGI SEISHIRO</em></span></h3>
					<br>
					<p> Nagi is a lazy and unmotivated teenager who likes to play video games. Even though he is full of laziness, he has great talent in playing football. With his reflexes, he's able to control the ball with his foot and score several goals. One of the reasons why he plays football is to achieve his dream of being the world's best striker, along with his best friend, Reo, that he had ups and downs with.</p>

					<br>
					<p> Reo is a charismatic, intelligent, wealthy, and ambitious player of Blue Lock. As he is well-rounded, he excels in academics, sports, and interpersonal skills. Growing up with getting everything he wasn't interested in, he found out about football and it was the only thing he ever wanted to do since then. Inviting Nagi to play with him, they improved incredibly and skillfully. </p>

					<h3><span style="color: #ebbcbf"><em>CHIGIRI HYOMA</em></span></h3>
					<br>
					<p> Chigiri is a confident and intense individual who loves running past players in football. He used to be cocky and egoistic, but after tearing his ACL, his sense of superiority broke down. Because of this, he was afraid of losing the skill to play football, which meant losing his identity. Thanks to Blue Lock, Chigiri regained his confidence and confidently played football with his retained intense passion and emotion.</p>
